### LoRA-from-Scratch

This repository implements a "Low-Rank Adaptation (LoRA)" model from scratch, using Python and Jupyter Notebooks. LoRA is a technique for fine-tuning large-scale machine learning models efficiently by reducing the number of trainable parameters.

---

## Features

- **Custom Implementation**: Build LoRA from the ground up for better understanding and flexibility.
- **Efficient Fine-Tuning**: Enable parameter-efficient training for large-scale models.
- **Python and Jupyter Notebooks**: Code is well-documented and easy to follow for learning or adapting.

---

## Requirements

To set up the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.8 or later
- Jupyter Notebook
- Necessary Python libraries (see below)

Install the dependencies with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/NgToanRob/LoRA-from-Scratch.git
   cd LoRA-from-Scratch
   ```

2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Explore the notebooks to understand the implementation and run the code.

## Repository Structure

- **`notebooks/`**: Contains Jupyter Notebooks with step-by-step implementation of LoRA.
- **`src/`**: Core Python files for the LoRA implementation.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of Python dependencies.
